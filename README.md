# 👋 Hi, I'm Dylan Dsouza

🎓 I'm an undergraduate Data Science student at the University of California San Diego, specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, tell compelling stories, and drive impactful decisions.

## 🔍 What I Do
I enjoy working with intricate datasets—**extracting**, **transforming**, and **synthesizing** data to:
- uncover actionable insights,
- build meaningful visualizations,
- and support science-driven, data-informed decision-making.

My work bridges **computation**, **storytelling**, and **scientific curiosity**, often inspired by the patterns found in the natural world 🌍.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, Java, R, C/C++, HTML/CSS, SQL
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Git, VS Code, Streamlit

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Coral reef restoration with machine learning 🌊
- Shot pattern analysis in the NBA 🏀
- Social impact projects leveraging data for good

## 🎥 Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me behind a camera lens 📸 or outdoors running and hiking. My love for **photography** and **videography** often reflects the same appreciation for natural patterns that fuel my work in data.
